# Sorting Visualizer

This is a project that visualizes the sorting of a given array with multiple algorithm options. 
I started this project because I was always fascinated that the concept of organization could be so easily captured within algorithms, as well as the fact that some core mathematical principles can make some incredibly-fast algorithms.
